Most adults use strategies to overcome natural limitations of memory retention and recollection \citep{brown-1992}. The only difference is how the citation will render. How you use them is up to you and your desired writing style. You can even lead a sentence with a textual citation. \citet{brown-1992} conducted much of her work around the development of a learning community in lieu of the traditional didactic classroom experience.
